Pakistan Prime Minister Iran Khan said that he will not tolerate the installation of a \'foreign government\' in Pakistan. The opposition says it has more than 172 votes in the 342-seat assembly, which needs a quarter of members present for a quorum. Prime Minister Imran Khan asked the people to hit the streets on Sunday and peacefully protest against an "imported government".
