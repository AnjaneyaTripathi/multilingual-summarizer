The motion picture academy on Friday banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars or any other academy event for 10 years. The move comes after a meeting of the academys board of governors to discuss a response to Smiths actions. At the 94th Oscars, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock after the latter made a joke about his wife, actor Jada Pinkett Smith.
