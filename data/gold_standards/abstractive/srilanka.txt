 Sri Lanka's central bank hiked interest rates by a record 700 basis points Friday as police fired tear gas at hundreds of students protesting over the economic crisis. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 due to rising inflation (about 19 percent) and deteriorating living conditions. Students were seen marching towards the Prime Minister's residence in the rain this evening.
