Imran Khan No-Trust Vote Live: With the Supreme Court reconvening the National Assembly, the no-confidence vote against Khan will now be held on Saturday at 10 am. 
Pakistan Prime Minister Iran Khan, while addressing the nation late Friday ahead of today’s no-confidence vote, said that he will not tolerate the installation of a “foreign government” in Pakistan and that he will turn to the public for support if such a thing happens. 
Calling on the people of Pakistan to protect the country's sovereignty, Prime Minister Imran Khan last night asked the people to hit the streets on Sunday and peacefully protest against an "imported government". It is insulting that someone from outside is ordering this to 22 crore people," he said.
The National Assembly, the lower house of the Parliament, is going to vote on the no-confidence motion against Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan today. According to Pakistani media, Imran Khan wants to make himself a 'martyr' during the no-confidence motion. He said the ruling party would launch a mass protest movement against the future government and would launch an election campaign to garner support for a return to power. He further said that senior and loyal workers and leaders of the party would be given tickets for the next elections and no disgruntled member would be involved in the reorganization of the party.
Imran will now have to face a no-confidence motion, which will be put to a vote on April 9. Why the defeat of Imran Khan when the no-confidence motion is being voted on April 9? On April 3, Qasim Khan Suri, deputy speaker of the National Assembly, rejected the no-confidence motion, saying Khan was involved in a plot to overthrow the government.
