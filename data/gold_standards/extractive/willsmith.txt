At the 94th Oscars, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock after the latter made a joke about his wife, actor Jada Pinkett Smith. The motion picture academy on Friday banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars or any other academy event for 10 years following his slap of Chris Rock at the Academy Awards. 

“The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year. However, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage,” the academy said in a statement.
'The Man in Black' actor Will Smith is in the headlines these days not for his performance, but for a controversy related to the Oscars. Meanwhile, there is another news related to him which is a big blow for his fans.

Hollywood actor Will Smith will no longer be able to attend the Oscars for the next 10 years. Will has been banned for "slapping" famous American comedian and actor Chris Rock at the Oscars 2022 ceremony. 

David Rubin, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and Dan Hudson, chief executive, said in a statement that the '94 Oscar ceremony was significant for many.
