It felt like a scene from the Cold War, a perilous episode from a bygone era. The repercussions were immediate, and far-reaching. Still, Russia has superior military might, and Mr. Putin has indicated that he likely won’t back down from his ultimate goal of capturing Kyiv, toppling Ukraine’s democratically elected government, and subsuming the country into Russia’s orbit. With the war grinding on, U.S. intelligence agencies say Mr. Putin has been frustrated by the slow pace of the military advance and Russian commanders have been increasingly intensifying attacks on civilian targets and infrastructure and resorting to tactics used in previous wars in Chechnya and Syria: flattening cities with overwhelming and indiscriminate firepower.
The Russia-Ukraine War is now moving towards the Third World War. This time NATO is believed to be the reason behind the war between Russia and Ukraine. 
Even after separation, Russia's influence was visible to a large extent in Ukraine.
Russia is likely to carry out a chemical attack in Ukraine. In a major blow to Ukraine, the United States has rejected Poland's offer to supply 28 MiG-29 fighter jets. The US Department of Defense has rejected a proposal to transfer a Polish MiG-29 fighter jet to a US Air Force base in Germany. Poland's decision comes as a shock to the US government.
